# Overview

This repo will contain a bunch of langchain examples as I explore what we can do with it. Seems awesome so far!

## Setup and running

Make sure you have an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable. Then install the Python requirements.
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have an issue installing the requirements, try setting this environment variable and installing again:
```bash
export HNSWLIB_NO_NATIVE=1
```
